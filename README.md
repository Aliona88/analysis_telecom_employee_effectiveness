# Analysis of the operator's efficiency in a virtual communication company.

>*Note: this project was created exclusively for the presentation of skills.*

**The virtual communications company wants to improve the company's service standards and renegotiate employee agreements.
For these purposes, the company is developing a new feature that will provide supervisors with information about the least efficient operators.**

This repository is an attempt to answer who are inefficient operators and by what criteria to define them. 

The project consists of 4 parts: 
* Project Decomposition
* Project Implementation
* Project Presentation
* Project Dashboard

**Decomposition of the project**, in fact, is the analysis of the task. It is a technique that involves defining and breaking down tasks into steps and substeps necessary to achieve the goal of the task.

Decomposition is a highly recommended step in data analytics projects that provides a general deep understanding of the task, helps the team work together, and saves a lot of time for the next phase, the project implementation stage. Decomposition is a great plan to achieve your goals without wasting time and human resources. 

In terms of **Project Implementation**, decomposed project stages are performed. However, at the same time, the data analysis process is flexible, which means that during data preprocessing and detailed exploratory data analysis, new results can change planned steps.

**Project Presentation** is published on Google Drive. [Link to the presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ErYiXI6F8TWRp-wZeqbTSL9F0GIezDwT/view?usp=sharing)

**Project Dashboard** is published on Tableau Public. [Link to the dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Telecomoperatorsefficiency/TelecomOperatorsEfficiency?:language=en&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link)

**Please, pay attention:**

Sometimes GitHub fails to render the *.ipynb notebooks and you get the message *"Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?"* when trying to view a *.ipynb on a GitHub page. In this case, [you can use a workaround.](https://github.com/Aliona88/analysis_telecom_employee_effectiveness/blob/master/if_notebook_not_loaded.md#a-workaround)
