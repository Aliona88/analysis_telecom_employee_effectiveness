# Analysis of the operator's efficiency in a virtual communication company.

**The virtual communications company wants to improve the company's service standards and renegotiate employee agreements.
For these purposes, the company is developing a new feature that will provide supervisors with information about the least efficient operators.**

This repository is an attempt to answer who are inefficient operators and by what criteria to define them. The project consists of 2 stages: task decomposition and project implementation.

The analytical task and dataset used in this project are dummies. The project was created exclusively for practice.
